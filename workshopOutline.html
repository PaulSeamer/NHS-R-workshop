<h1>Evaluating complex interventions</h1>
<p>The key questions for any healthcare initiative, national or local, remain the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have patient outcomes and the quality of care improved?</li>
<li>Has the patient or carer experience of care improved?</li>
<li>Do the changes deliver better value (better outcomes for lower cost)?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this workshop participants will explore the role of evaluation and the relative merits of different types of study design. The primary focus is understanding a small number of quasi-experimental study designs*, including interrupted time series, retrospective matched control, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs. Participants will be shown how to apply these approaches using the R statistical computing environment, and guidance will be offered on the practical considerations of evaluation using routinely collected NHS data. Participants will also be introduced to examples of evaluation projects undertaken by the <a href="https://www.strategyunit.co.uk/">Strategy Unit</a> and the <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/">Health Foundation</a>.</p>

&ast; these studies can be used to estimate the causal impact of an intervention on an outcome in a similar manner to experimental designs but without the element of random assignment to treatment or control.
